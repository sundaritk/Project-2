# Marriage isn't Dead!

Source for all data is Decennial Census (years 1960 to 2000) and American Community Survey (years 2001-2012), via IPUMS USA.

Except in the divorce file, figures represent share of the relevant population that has never been married (MARST == 6 in the IPUMS data). Note that in the story, charts generally show the share that have ever been married, which is simply 1 - n. In the divorce file, figures are share of the relevant population that is currently divorced, conditional on having ever been married.
